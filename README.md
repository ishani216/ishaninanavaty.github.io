		<h1>Hi!</h1>
		<h2>My name is Ishani Nanavaty</h2>
		

		<p>
			My career goals are to become a computer programmer and get my bachelor’s degree  one day.  I will show up on time and put forth my best effort every day. I believe that anything can be achieved through hard work and dedication. I hope to receive a good education and use my own skills to make a difference in the world. No matter what profession I enter in my career, I hope that I can walk away knowing I made a difference in someone’s life.  I will always have a positive attitude and do the task given to me to the fullest.

			You probably know about Progressive Insurance because of their commercials
			which feature "Flo", the extremely perky saleswoman in the white apron:

			Over the years I have been interested in making scrapbooks. Which is a method, 
      an art for preserving, presenting, arranging personal and family history in the form of a book, box, card.
		</p>

		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<td>Choose the size of your scrapbook</td>
				<td>Size of it depends on the sizes and amount of pictures</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Gather Design Materials</td>
				<td>Such as patterned paper, ribbons, stenciled designs, and word art.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Plan the layout</td>
				<td>Shows how you like pictures to be placed.</td>
			</tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Start Putting Pages Together</td>
          <td>If the scrapbook doesn’t come with a printed background already included on each page, 
          you will likely have to cut and glue printed paper for each page’s background. Once the background is 
          applied, you can begin laying your pictures in their proper places, using your layouts as a guide.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Fill Each Page of the SCrapbook Until it is complete<td>
          <td> Work your way through your scrapbook until all of your pictures have been included and designs added.</td>
          </tr>
         </table>
